<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m a passionate web development student with a strong interest in creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I'm currently building my skills in front-end and back-end technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I enjoy solving problems with code and continuously strive to learn new tools and best practices in the ever-evolving tech world.
My goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to meaningful projects that improve user experiences. Whether working on personal projects or collaborating with a team, I bring enthusiasm, creativity, and a commitment to writing efficient and maintainable code.
</p>

<p>I’ve completed several projects that showcase my growing expertise—from building responsive landing pages to developing dynamic web applications with JavaScript and React. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of planning, testing, and delivering user-centered designs. I enjoy taking on challenges and continuously look for opportunities to apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’m also interested in UI/UX design, version control with Git, and learning about deployment and DevOps practices. I believe in the value of teamwork and clear communication, and I’m always eager to collaborate with others who are just as excited about technology. As I continue my journey in web development, I’m committed to building useful, accessible, and engaging web experiences.</p>
